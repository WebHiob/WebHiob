    The Spring Security configuration providing the stateless authentication is
    shown below:
     <pre>
        <code>
&lt;http pattern="/facelets/riaToken/**"
          use-expressions="true"
          create-session="stateless"
          entry-point-ref="unauthorizedTokenEntryPoint"
          authentication-manager-ref="authenticationManager"&gt;
    &lt;custom-filter ref="authenticationTokenProcessingFilter" position="FORM_LOGIN_FILTER"/&gt;
    &lt;intercept-url pattern="/facelets/riaToken/secret" access="isAuthenticated()"/&gt;
    &lt;intercept-url pattern="/facelets/riaToken/admin" access="hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')"/&gt;
&lt;/http&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>
    The <span class="italic">auto-config="true"</span> attribute used in all other lessons
    is removed, because this solution uses the custom authentication (default value is
    false). The <span class="italic">create-session="stateless"</span> attribute provides that <span class="italic">Spring Security</span> filter
    will not create any session and will not use the session even if it is already created.
    In all of the other lessons using <span class="italic">Spring Security</span>, the access to the resources
    was based only on the authentication (the role of the person has not been taken
    into account). This configuration provides, that the access to the
    resource under the <span class="italic">/api/riaToken/secret</span> URL have got only authenticated users,
    but to the resource under the <span class="italic">/api/riaToken/admin</span> URL - only users with
the ADMIN role. The value of the <span class="italic"> entry-point-ref</span> attribute points to the
implementation of the  <span class="className">AuthenticationEntryPoint</span> interface to provide a custom
error code (403 in this solution) in the case of authentication or authorization error. This interface contains only one method
(<span class="italic">commence</span>), which is called when
an authentication exception is detected. Proposed implementation of this method
making that the custom error code will be sent, has got the following one-line body:
<br/>
<code>
    response.sendError(403);
</code>
<br/>
<br/>
To provide a token,
there are some libraries implementing the standard of JSON Web Token (JWT).
JWT is a relatively new token format which allows to transfer a message encoded
as a JSON object, that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS). In some libraries implementing JWT have been found some vulnerabilities
allowing attackers to bypass the verification step. Because of that and to better
understand how the token-based authentication works, this solution explains the
custom implementation of the token. Additionally this approach has got a better
didactic value then using a library.
<br/>
Listing below contains the most important methods of the TokenUtils class, that
are responsible for the token creation and validation:

<pre>
    <code>
public static String createToken(UserDetails userDetails) {
    long expiresTime = calculateExpirationTime();
    String token = userDetails.getUsername() + SEPARATOR +
                                    expiresTime + SEPARATOR +
                                    TokenUtils.computeSignature(userDetails, expiresTime);
    return token;
}

private static String computeSignature(UserDetails userDetails, long expires) {
    MessageDigest messageDigest = getMD5Digest();
    String signature = userDetails.getUsername() + SEPARATOR +
    expires + SEPARATOR +
    userDetails.getPassword() + SEPARATOR +
    TokenUtils.SECRET_KEY;
    byte[] signatureInBytes = signature.getBytes();
    byte[] digest = messageDigest.digest(signatureInBytes);
    return new String(Hex.encode(digest));
}

public static boolean validateToken(String authToken, UserDetails userDetails) {
    boolean valid = false;
    String[] parts = authToken.split(SEPARATOR);
    long expires = Long.parseLong(parts[1]);
    String signature = parts[2];

    if (expires >= System.currentTimeMillis()) {
        valid = signature.equals(TokenUtils.computeSignature(userDetails, expires));
    }
    return valid;
}
   </code>
 </pre>

    The custom token format as follows: <span class="italic">username:expiration_time:signature</span>.
    <br/>
    The <span class="italic">createToken</span> method creates
    the token based on the username and passwords (from the  <span class="className">UserDetails</span> interface).
    The <span class="italic">computeSignature</span> method calculates the digest (using the Message-Digest algorithm
    5 (MD5) function) based on the user details, expiration time and secret
    key. The <span class="italic">validateToken</span> method validates the token, which contains the following
    steps:
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">
            Splitting the received string based on the : separator.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            Checking if the expiration time is greater than the current time and if it is, than
            calculating the signature using the same methods as to create token's signature.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            Returning the result of the comparison of the calculated and received signatures
            or returning <span class="italic">false</span>, if the expiration time is less than the current time.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <br/>
    The username and expiration time from the token are very easy to forge, however
    it will not cause any danger, because of the necessity that, the received and
    calculated signatures must be in accordance. The signature is not easy to forge,
    because to calculate it, the MD5 digest and secret key have been used. This lesson requires a custom filter to
    provide a proper authentication and
    authorization based on the token. Proposed implementation of the  <span class="italic">doFilter</span> method
    is shown below:

    <pre>
        <code>
@Override
public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException
{
    HttpServletRequest httpRequest = (HttpServletRequest) request;

    String authToken = httpRequest.getHeader("X-Auth-Token");
    String userName = TokenUtils.getUsernameFromToken(authToken);

    if (userName != null) {
        UserDetails userDetails = userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(userName);
        Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> authorities = userDetails.getAuthorities();

        if (TokenUtils.validateToken(authToken, userDetails)) {
            UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authentication =
                    new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(userDetails, null, authorities);
            authentication.setDetails(new WebAuthenticationDetailsSource().buildDetails(httpRequest));
            SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication);
        }
    }
    chain.doFilter(request, response);
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    The method reads the token from the request header and takes the username from the token. The username allows the get
    user details and validate the token. If the token is valid, the filter adds
    the user's authorities to the context of this request. Other filters will check the
    user's authorities and will deny or will grant the access to the requested resource.
    If token is not valid, the authentication details will not be set and other filters will
    deny the access.
    <br/>
    Token can be stored in the local storage in the browser (feature of HTML5), which
    means that is not automatically sent by the browser such as cookies. This is safer
    solution, because it make impossible the CSRF attack, however it causes, that
    this token must be added in each request on one's own. The AngularJS requests
    interceptor can simplify this task modifying the request before sending. Proposed
    implementation of this interceptor adding the <span class="italic">X-Auth-Token</span> header with the token
    as a value is shown below:

    <pre>
        <code>
$httpProvider.interceptors.push(function ($q, $rootScope, $location, $window) {
    return {
        'request': function (config) {
            if (config.url.indexOf('RIA') > -1 && config.url.indexOf('login') == -1) {
                lastURL = $location.path();
            }

            var isRestCall = config.url.indexOf('RIA') > -1 || config.url.indexOf('ria') > -1;
            var authToken = $window.localStorage.token;
            if (isRestCall && authToken != "undefined") {
                config.headers['X-Auth-Token'] = authToken;
            }
            return config || $q.when(config);
        }
    };
});
        </code>
    </pre>

    At the end, the user should create the
    response interceptor to provide a redirection to the login page in case of the 403 or 401
    response code:

    <pre>
        <code>

$httpProvider.interceptors.push(function ($q, $rootScope, $location) {
    return {
        'responseError': function (rejection) {
            var status = rejection.status;
            if (status == 401 || status == 403) {
                $location.path("/RIASecurityTokenBased/lesson/loginTab");
            }
            return $q.reject(rejection);
         }
    };
});
        </code>
    </pre>
