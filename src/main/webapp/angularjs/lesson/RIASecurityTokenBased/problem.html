   The default <span class="italic">Spring Security</span> configuration uses the cookie-based authentication. RIA communicates with the
   server using Ajax requests to avoid multiple re-downloading the whole pages. After
   sending the request as an unauthenticated user, the Spring Security sends a redirect
   response with the 302 HTTP code and URL to the login page. With non-Ajax
   requests, the browser automatically redirects to the given page. After sending an
   Ajax request through the function from the AngularJS or jQuery library, the response
   HTTP code will be 200 and the received data will be the HTML source code
   of the current page. It means that without a special effort, the user will not see the login page.

    The additionally problem, that this lesson tries to solve it to prepare the server side for the scalability in the future.
   To make it possible, one of the task, that should be done is to provide a stateless authentication.
