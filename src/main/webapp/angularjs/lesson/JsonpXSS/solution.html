    There is no way to provide a JSONP response data validation on the client side,
    therefore the only solution to protect from JSONP XSS attack is to load the data
    by own server, provide a validation and then send back the data to the browser. It
    makes that the own server will be more loaded, but it provides the safety.
	<br>

    The proposed solution for this security problem is to make a typical JSON
    request to the own server (with the same origin) with the callback parameter
    and the URL parameter, whose value specifies where the user want to make a
    cross-origin request.
    Server downloads the potentially malicious data and makes
    a validation. However
    these data are not dangerous for the server, because it does not evaluate any JavaScript
    commands.After validation the server returns the safe
    data as a JSONP response to the browser.
    The method providing the solution is shown below and you should use it in the  <span class="className">JsonpXSSAngularController</span> class:

 	<pre><code class="java">
        @RequestMapping(value = "/secure")
        public String secureJsonp(@RequestParam(value = "url") String url,
                    @RequestParam(value = "callback") String callback) throws IOException
        {
            String secureJsonp;
            URL insecureUrl = new URL(url + "?callback=" + callback);
            try (InputStream inputStream = insecureUrl.openStream();
                    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream)))
            {
                String jsonpResponse = "";
                String inputLine;
                while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null)
                {
                    jsonpResponse += inputLine;
                }
                secureJsonp = Parser.jsonpToSafeJsonParser(jsonpResponse);
                secureJsonp = callback + "(" + secureJsonp + ");";
            }
            return secureJsonp;
        }
	</code>
      </pre>

    The <span class="italic">jsonpToSafeJsonParser</span> method of the <span class="className">Parser</span> class uses the <span class="className">JsonSanitizer</span> class
    from the OWASP JSON Sanitizer library providing a JSON validation. The result of using the 'secureJsonp' method  after
    performing the same JSONP XSS attack, is shown below:
    <pre>
        <code>
            CALLBACK({"date":"09:04:49","attack":"alert","JSONP XSS":null});
        </code>
    </pre>
    The alert function and parameter have been divided and the brackets have been
    removed, therefore the attack is no more possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>

	Additionally you have to change the value for the url variable in two methods from the <span class="italic">JsonpXSSController.js</span> file:
	<pre>
        <code class="js">
 // in doRequest function
 var url = "/facelets/jsonpAngular/secure?callback=JSON_CALLBACK&url="+ $location.protocol() + "://" +
            $location.host() + ":" + $location.port() +"/facelets/jsonpAngular/insecure";

 // in doCustomRequest function
  var url = "/facelets/jsonpAngular/secure?callback=JSON_CALLBACK&url=" + $scope.customUrl;
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>
