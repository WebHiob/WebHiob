    The simplest way to solve this problem could be using the same approach as
    introduced in the solution of the Automatic redirect to the login page after session
    expires lesson. However if the application has got many places requiring the
    access to the secured content, it will be very inconvenient to handle the codes
    of the responses in all places. However the AngularJS framework provides a
    solution to this problem - an interceptor, that allows to the global errors handling,
    pre-processing of requests or postprocessing of responses.

    <br/>
    The default Spring Security configuration uses the stateful (cookie-based) approach.
    All requests from AngularJS are through Ajax, therefore there is no need
    to distinguish between kinds of the requests. It allows to use a simpler approach
    than shown in the solution of the Automatic redirection to the login page after the
    session expires lesson - there is no need to use a filter. To solve this lesson, the
    function sending the Ajax request and receiving the response has to recognize if the
    response code means redirection. It is not possible to handle the HTTP redirect code
    (302) through JavaScript from the browser, however it is enough to change the response
    code sending by the Spring Security filter, when there is a problem with the
    authentication. It could be done using a filter, but also by adding the <span class="italic">entry-point-ref</span>
    attribute to the <span class="italic">http</span> tag in the <span class="italic">Spring Security</span> configuration.
    The value of this attribute has to point to the class implementing the <span class="className">AuthenticationEntryPoint</span> interface.
    This interface contains only one method (<span class="italic">commence</span>), which is called when
    an authentication exception is detected. Proposed implementation of this method
    making that the custom error code will be sent, has got the following one-line body:
    <br/>
    <code>
        response.sendError(901);
    </code>
    <br/>
    <br/>

    The main AngularJS file of WebHiob (<span class="italic">\src\main\webapp\angularjs\js\main.js</span>)
    requires adding an interceptor, that redirects to the login page in the case of the
    authentication error (901). Proposed implementation of the interceptor is shown below:

    <pre>
        <code>

$httpProvider.interceptors.push(function ($q, $rootScope, $location) {
    return {
            'responseError': function (rejection) {
                var status = rejection.status;
                if (status == 901) {
                    $location.path("/RIASecurityCookieBased/lesson/loginTab");
                }
                return $q.reject(rejection);
            }
    };
});
        </code>
    </pre>

    The code checks the response status and redirects to the login page
    (line 5) if the server responses with the 901 code (line 6).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After providing the described above solution for this lesson and clicking on the
    secret tab as an unauthenticated user, the user should see the login page.
