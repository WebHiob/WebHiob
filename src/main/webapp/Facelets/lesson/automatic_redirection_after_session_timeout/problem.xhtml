<div>

  Assume that one day the user forgets to log out from the bank's web page. After
  the session expires, there is no way to make a new request and get a valid response,
  because after a new request the Spring Security filter redirects to the login page.
  However without sending any new requests the information on the page will be still
  visible, which can cause, that someone unauthorized will see them.
