    WebHiob uses the currently newest Spring version â€“ 4.1.6.RELEASE, therefore
    there is no way provide a lesson vulnerable to the EL injection attack, thus this
    lesson is not interactive. The Spring versions affected to EL injection attack include:

    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">
            3.0.0 to 3.0.5
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            2.5.0 to 2.5.6.SEC02 (community releases)
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            2.5.0 to 2.5.7.SR01 (subscription customers)
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            Earlier versions may be also affected
        </li>
    </ul>

    To fix this security issue the Spring framework has introduced a new context
    parameter - <span class="italic">springJspExpressionSupport</span>, which set to false disable the double resolving
    issue. However this parameter is only available in the following
    versions [30]:
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">
            3.0.6 onwards
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            2.5.6.SEC03 onwards (community releases)
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            2.5.7.SR02 (subscription customers)
        </li>
    </ul>

    For others versions it is recommended to provide an input validation to avoid
    that user's data will be interpreted as another EL expression.
