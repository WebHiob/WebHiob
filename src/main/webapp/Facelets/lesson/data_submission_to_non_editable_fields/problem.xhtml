<div>
   WebHiob takes advantage of the auto-binding feature for the
   <span class="className">Account</span> class. Instance of this class is stored in the session context, which
   means that after calling the update method, the application will bind properties to
   the already existing object. Based on the form, it could be inferred, that only
   two fields will be bound, (name and dailyLimit) leaving the login field untouched.
   However if the attacker changes the body of the request (e.g. using Zed Attack
   Proxy (ZAP)) and adds the <span class="italic">login</span> field with some value e.g.
    <br/>
    <span class="italic">login=victim</span>,
    <br/> then the auto-binding feature sets the new value also to the login field. In this way, the
   attacker can change the daily limit of the victim's account.
