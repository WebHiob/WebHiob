   Spring MVC is prepared for this security issue and provides the following methods
   for the data binder: <span class="italic">setAllowedFields</span> and
    <span class="italic">setDisallowedFields</span>. It is
   always recommended to provide a <span class="italic">white-list</span> validation, however if only one field
   should not be bound, then it is more convenient to use the <span class="italic">setDisallowedFields</span>
   method. In this lessons only the <span class="italic">login</span> filed should not be bound, therefore the
   latter method is a good choice. The code providing the security is shown below and should be used in the
    <span class="className">DataSubmissionToNonEditableFieldsController</span> class:

   <pre class="java">
      <code>
         @InitBinder
         public void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
            binder.setDisallowedFields("login");
         }
      </code>
   </pre>

</div>
