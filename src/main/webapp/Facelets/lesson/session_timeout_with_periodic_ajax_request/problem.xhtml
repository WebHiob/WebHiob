<div>
    Leaving the existing <span class="italic">Spring Security</span> configuration without any changes
    will make, that the session will never expire. It could seem impossible, because
    the session timeout is set to one minute. However to the server are coming the
    requests every 500 ms (through Ajax). The default Spring's filters do not make
    any difference if the request is through Ajax or not. Therefore every 500 ms the
    session is refreshed, which causes that finally the session will never expire. Thus
    to complete this lesson the user does not have to do anything special - just click
    on the link after one minute and view the secret page, which will be sent the the
    browser, because the session will be still valid.
