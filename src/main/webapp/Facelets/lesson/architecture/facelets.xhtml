    <h4>Resolving the view</h4>

    The <span class="italic">Facelets</span> view technology uses the server side view resolver to find the view file based on the lesson view name from URL,
    that is name after last slash in the URL (e.g. for the  <span class="italic">/facelets/lesson/model_view_injection</span> URL, the lesson view name is
    <span class="italic">model_view_injection</span>). Spring does not support the <span class="italic">Facelets</span> view technology by default, therefore it
    has been used the <span class="className">UrlBasedViewResolver</span> class with the custom view class (<span class="className">FaceletsView</span>),
    which supports <span class="italic">Facelets</span> as a view. <span class="className">LessonController</span> (Spring controller) uses the lesson view name from the URL to find the lesson,
    which will be used by the view resolver to prepare the HTML page.
    Main view (<span class="italic">\src\main\webapp\facelets\index.xhtml</span>) is a template,
    which uses a JSF bean to provide the lesson name and paths to the security problem description and solution HTML pages.
    <span class="className">LessonController</span> initializes this bean with the proper values for the specified lesson.
