    <h4>Resolving the view</h4>

    AnuglarJS uses its extension â€“ <a href="http://angular-route-segment.com">angular-route-segment</a> to provide the tree-like
    nested view and advanced flow handling. It makes easier to develop the web
    pages with many tabs and tabs inside each tab (<span class="italic">WebHiob</span> takes advantage of this
    feature in the session management lessons developed in AngularJS). This extension
    is also used to resolve a view based on the lesson view name, which is a name after
    first slash after hash (<span class="italic">#</span>) in URL (e.g. for the <span class="italic">/angularjs/#/JsonpXSS/lesson</span> URL,
    the view name is <span class="italic">JsonpXSS</span>). Based on the view name, WebHiob provides a name of the lesson controller and
    paths to security problem description and solution HTML
    pages. The main AngularJS controller (<span class="italic">\src\main\webapp\angularjs\js\main.js</span>) initializes
    the <span class="italic">jsTree</span> view and takes care of displaying the correct name of the lessons
    above the lesson tab.
