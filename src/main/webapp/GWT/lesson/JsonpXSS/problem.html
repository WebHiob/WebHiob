    Using the JSONP technique requires trust, that a data provider sends a valid
    data without any malicious part. Unlike to CORS request,
    after receiving the results, there is no way to validate a data, therefore an attacker can
    provide any XSS attack. The method from the <span class="className">JsonpXSSController</span> class returning the malicious JSONP response
    is shown below:

   <pre><code class="java">
       @RequestMapping(value = "/insecure")
       public String insecureJsonp(@RequestParam(value = "callback") String callback)
       {
            return callback + "({date:\"09:04:49\", attack:alert(\"JSONP XSS\")});";
       }
   </code>
      </pre>

    This method symbolises the method from the external server, which source
    code is not public disclosed (thus there is no way to change this method). JSONP
    response from this server is shown below:
    <br/>
    <code>
        CALLBACK({date:"09:04:49", attack:alert("JSONP XSS")});
    </code>
    <br/>
    Second part of the returned JSON will be interpreted as a
    JavaScript command and executed. In this example the user will only see an alert
    message, but attacker can provide much more complex XSS attack.
